## Design ##
+ High contrast
+ Mobile first
+ [Colors Pallete](https://colorhunt.co/palette/ff917bc13131fffdf2ff0202)

## Other aspects ##
+ For language abbreviations, use ISO 639-1, [reference here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes). If possible, have a *database* with the table from the site and dynamically access it.

## Other ideas ##
1. Nav bar:
    + Display style:
        - *On mobile*: the button spead across the main axis, separated by a thin vertical line.
        - *On larger screens*: buttons float right.  

    + ~~once the top bar dessapears, show their icons on the side of the page, as a modal.~~
    + ~~have the nav bar fixed on top~~
    + have the navbar hiding when scroll down, and appear when scroll up.

2. New price
    + When click/touch it, will show a *message bobble* saying "new price from April 2023".

3. Language separation bar
    + should be like 3-4 px thick and rounded at the ends. I think I should use an "br"


## To fix ##
1. Navbar:
    + When using the links, the navbar dissapear when should not.
